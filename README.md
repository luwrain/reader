# Documents reader

This repository contains basic components for reading hypertext documents
in the most comfortable way for  the blind and partially-sighted.
The support of any particular format  can be implemented in additional extensions,
including written in JavaScript.
Usually such filters are created using popular Java libraries for reading office documents, like [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/) and others.
One of the most important of the reader features is the support of [the Daisy format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAISY_Digital_Talking_Book)

This repository is a part of the LUWRAIN project.
LUWRAIN is a platform for the creation of apps for the blind and partially-sighted.
